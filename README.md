## Project Overview
Qiwi is a blockchain-based loyalty program that leverages the Metis Layer 2 blockchain to offer a secure, efficient, and sustainable solution for businesses and customers. By earning and redeeming Qiwi Qoins, users can enjoy eco-friendly rewards while promoting transparency and ethical sourcing.

## Inspiration
Traditional loyalty programs face significant challenges such as inefficiency, insecurity, and high operational costs. Many existing programs struggle with transparency, leading to a lack of trust among customers regarding the sourcing and production of rewards. Inspired by the potential of blockchain technology to address these issues, we set out to create Qiwi.

## What it Does
Qiwi offers a comprehensive loyalty program where businesses can issue, transfer, and redeem points called Qiwi Qoins. The program ensures secure and tamper-proof transactions using blockchain technology, eliminating the risk of fraud and manipulation. It also tracks the ethical and sustainable sourcing of rewards, providing transparency to customers about the origins and environmental impact of the rewards they redeem.

### Key Features
- **Issuance of Qiwi Qoins**: Businesses can easily issue loyalty points to customers based on their transactions and interactions.
- **Transfer of Qiwi Qoins**: Customers can transfer points to each other, fostering a community-driven loyalty program.
- **Redemption of Qiwi Qoins**: Customers can redeem points for a variety of rewards, with detailed information about the sustainability of each reward.
- **Sustainability Tracking**: Each reward's sourcing and production process is tracked on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## How We Built It
We developed Qiwi using a robust and modern technology stack that ensures both performance and security.

### Backend
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity to handle the issuance, transfer, and redemption of Qiwi Qoins.
- **Blockchain**: Deployed on the Metis Layer 2 blockchain for scalability and low transaction fees.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Built using Next.js to create a responsive and dynamic user experience.
- **Integration**: Used Web3.js to connect the frontend with the blockchain, enabling seamless interaction with the smart contracts.

### Tools
- **Hardhat**: Utilized for developing, testing, and deploying our smart contracts.
- **MetaMask**: Used for managing user accounts and facilitating transactions.

## Challenges We Ran Into
One significant challenge was ensuring seamless integration between the frontend and the blockchain. This required careful handling of asynchronous operations and managing user sessions securely. Testing the smart contracts thoroughly to ensure they were free of bugs and vulnerabilities was another critical challenge. Additionally, implementing sustainability tracking required extensive research to ensure we accurately represented the sourcing and production processes of rewards.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Successfully created a fully functional blockchain-based loyalty program.
- Implemented a sustainability tracking feature that aligns with our goal of promoting ethical and sustainable consumer practices.
- Developed a user-friendly web interface that enhances the overall user experience.

## What We Learned
- Gained valuable insights into blockchain technology and smart contract development.
- Learned how to effectively use Hardhat for testing and deploying contracts.
- Deepened our understanding of sustainable sourcing and how to implement it within a blockchain framework.

## What's Next?
- **Expansion**: Integrate more businesses and expand the rewards catalog.
- **Enhancements**: Add new features like mobile app support, advanced analytics, and personalized rewards.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with sustainability certifiers and blockchain auditors to further improve transparency and trust.
